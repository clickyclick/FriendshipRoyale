# FriendshipRoyale (Work in Progress)

A game about friendship

You will be dropped into an island with your fellow classmates where there can only be one survivor. Use quick thinking, guile and luck to come out on top. Inspired by Japanese film "Battle Royale"


## Status so far

We have implemented the basis of the game, you can do intial game setup, start the game loop and get some random events, pickup weapons and items.

Next steps: Combat, dropping and using items, location movement, actually ending the game (dying or winning), custom human pictures
